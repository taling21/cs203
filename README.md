# The python code is in a jupyter notebook names cs203ass.ipynb 
# The code can be run in a jupyter environment. Run the first cell to import necessary libraries
# Then run the rest of the cells to see the output
# The 3rd cell contains the result when n(sample size) is changed, keeping num_experiments (no of times the experiment is run) same
# The 4th cell contains when num_exp is changes, keeping n same
